# springboot-oauth

We have a Authorization server in springboot-oauth2-auth-server.

We have a Resource server in springboot-oauth2-resource-server.

I have Postman for testing login(/oauth/token) to Authorization server and getting resources from the Resource server.

## Authorization server
run schema.sql in database before or after starting the springboot-oauth2-auth-server project.
